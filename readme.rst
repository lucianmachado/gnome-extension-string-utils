After cloning the repo, the extension is practically installed yet disabled. In
order to enable it, you need to use gnome-tweak-tool - find the extension,
titled 'String Utils', in the 'Extensions' screen and turn it 'On'.
You may need to restart the shell (Alt+F2 and insert 'r' in the prompt) for the
extension to be listed there.
